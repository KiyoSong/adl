                    <p class="interview-dire"><b>Director</b>: Li Kuo & Dan Dan <br><b>Interviewer</b>: ADL</p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The original movie title was "Galactic Ant." Why the change to "Galactic Writer"?
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: "Galactic Ant" symbolized small characters in a big city, moving like ants. However, it confused people about the genre. Friends thought it was a sci-fi movie like "Blade Runner." We wanted to reflect a small screenwriter’s perspective. Director Li suggested "Galactic Writer," which felt fitting and cool.
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: What other titles were considered?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: We thought of names like "Six-Minute Screenwriter" and "Story King" to highlight the ordinariness of the screenwriters. However, "Galactic Writer" seemed more romantic and appropriate.

                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The word "爽" (satisfying) appears often in the movie. What scenes did you find particularly satisfying during creation or filming?
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: I enjoyed scenes like the two-minute segment for Douyin in "Save the Cat," Zhang arguing with investors, and his self-fantasy scene in bed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: I loved the opening of "Save the Cat," where characters break the fourth wall. It was created and filmed quickly, bringing us joy.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The film suggests that creation requires pain. Do you believe this, and does the film reflect your experiences?
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: Pain indeed serves as material for creation. Zhang’s setbacks mirror our own experiences, providing strength and inspiration for future works.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: We often find ourselves motivated by pain and failure, using them as material to keep pushing forward.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: How do you balance personal ideals with real-life constraints in your work?
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: After years of conforming to market demands, we wanted "Galactic Writer" to be a genuine reflection of our experiences. Future works might explore different themes and audience interactions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: Films like "The Annual Meeting Can't Stop" inspire us. They focus on real professional struggles rather than just romance, offering hope and confidence to creators.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The film contrasts the paths of Zhang Leyi and Keke. How do you view their choices?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: Keke's journey is about learning and seizing opportunities, not compromise. Her growth contrasts with Zhang Leyi's more stubborn path. Both perspectives are valid and essential for different kinds of personal growth.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The film touches on the pressure of achieving success by thirty. How do you view this mindset?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: Growth comes from all experiences, successful or not. "Galactic Writer" might not have been possible without our earlier failures.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: Failures have led us to unique creations. Success by thirty isn't necessary; continuous effort and reflection are more important.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: The ending discusses AI's impact on human creators. What are your thoughts?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: AI's potential to replace creators is concerning, but for now, it’s more of a tool. Human imperfection brings warmth to creative works.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: If AI replaces human creativity, it will prompt a broader societal reflection on humanity's role and value.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>ADL</b>: Any advice for aspiring creators?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Li</b>: "Be yourself." Whether you're like Zhang Zhi or Zhou Keke, both paths are valid. Find what makes you comfortable without losing your true self.
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Dan</b>: Be bold. Regardless of your age, take risks and pursue your passions.
