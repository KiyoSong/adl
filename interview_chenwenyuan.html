                    <p class="interview-dire"><b>Director</b>: Yingyi Li <br><b>Interviewer</b>: Mingyang Ma</p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: What is the origin of the film?
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: The film's origin is twofold. Firstly, I've always wanted to explore this topic, whether in short or long form. Initially, I had a feature film script about the struggles of a housewife trying to conceive a second child. This script entered the FIRST genre film testing room and received funding. We then created a short film that stands independently, focusing on fertility, featuring the same protagonist, Chen Wenyuan. This short film was a way for me to explore personal choices about marriage, relationships, and childbirth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: What is it like to make films in an "all-female crew" environment?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: Working with an all-female crew was very smooth and engaging. We shared many personal experiences and ideas due to our similar ages. The atmosphere was creative and collaborative. A specific incident where two crew members were caught on camera discussing personal topics led to misunderstandings, but it highlighted the existing workplace unfairness women face.

                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: Most of the audience watching the film will be amazed by the directness of the camera and the directness of the lines. How did you think to present it in such a direct way?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: I wanted to present the film in a way that felt direct and impactful. Since it's a short film, I felt freer to experiment. The script was written with specific visual and auditory stings in mind, aiming to provoke strong emotions.

                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: After the film was broadcast, what was the overall evaluation of the audience?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: The film received positive reviews and generated significant interest. People from various places wanted to see the film, showing that our approach resonated beyond just young film enthusiasts. Our aim was to provoke thought and discussion on the topic, which we achieved.

                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: We were impressed by the performance of the two actresses. How did they cooperate with Mei Ting and Qiu Tian?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: Mei Ting saw our announcement on social media and expressed interest. We met and decided to work together. Qiu Tian joined through her agent. Both actresses contributed significantly to the film's success.

                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: What do you think about the question raised in the film, whether childbirth can bring a better life to women?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: There is no absolute answer. The film raises this question to provoke thought across generations. For older generations, having children might have been seen as a way to improve life conditions. For us, the logic is different due to the high costs of raising children.

                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: What do you think of the development of our society in terms of female fertility?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: Society is progressing positively regarding female fertility, with improvements in healthcare and workplace policies. However, development varies by region, with big cities advancing faster than smaller ones.

                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: What should I pay more attention to when making films about women?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: Every aspect needs careful consideration. The story must resonate, and actors' performances are crucial. We rehearsed extensively to capture the right expressions and emotions, using detailed discussions and online readings due to the pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: Some people say that this film brings anxiety about "fear of marriage" and "fear of children." What do you think of this comment?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: These emotions depend on the viewer's personal experiences. Discussing such topics should be encouraged to face and understand these issues, rather than avoiding them. Addressing these fears can lead to personal growth and better decision-making.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Mingyang</b>: We see people asking questions "Why are the top people in the industry men?" What do you think of this phenomenon?
                    </p>

                    <p class="interview-chat">
                        <b>Yingyi</b>: Historically, patriarchal systems have dominated societies, resulting in male dominance in various industries, including film. However, the rise of feminism and awareness of gender equality is changing this trend. Although the balance is not yet proportional, more women and minorities are emerging in the industry. As female creators, we must continue to express our perspectives and inspire others to do the same, fostering a more inclusive environment.
